Given a binary array arr[] containing only 0s and 1s and an integer k, you are allowed to flip at most k 0s to 1s.
Find the maximum number of consecutive 1's that can be obtained in the array after performing the operation at most k times.
Code(.py):
class Solution:
    def maxOnes(self, arr, k):
        # code here
        maxlen=0
        l=0
        r=0
        zeros=0
        while r < len(arr):
            if(arr[r] == 0):
                zeros+=1
            while zeros > k:
                if arr[l] == 0:
                    zeros-=1
                l += 1

            length = r - l + 1
            maxlen = max(maxlen, length)
            
            r+=1
            
        return maxlen
