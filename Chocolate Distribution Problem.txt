Given an array arr[] of positive integers, where each value represents the number of chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates.
There are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets among m students such that -
      i. Each student gets exactly one packet.
     ii. The difference between maximum number of chocolates given to a student and minimum number of chocolates given to a student is 
         minimum and return that minimum possible difference.
Code:
int findMinDiff(vector<int>& a, int m) {
        // code here
        sort(a.begin(),a.end());
        int n=a.size();
        if (m == 0 || n == 0) return 0;
        if (n < m) return -1;
        int min_diff = INT_MAX;
        
        for(int i=0; i + m - 1 < n; i++){
           int current_diff = a[i + m - 1] - a[i];
           if (current_diff < min_diff) {
               min_diff = current_diff;
            }
        }
        
        return min_diff;
}
