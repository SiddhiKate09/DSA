Example: Given an array A[] and a number x, check for a pair in A[]
with the sum as x, where N is:
1: 1 <= N <= 103
2: 1 <= N <= 105
3: 1 <= N <= 108
For Case 1: A naive solution that is using two for-loops works as it gives us a complexity
of O(N2), which even in the worst case will perform 106 operations which are well under 108. 
Of course, O(N) and O(NlogN) is also acceptable in this case.

For Case 2: We have to think of a better solution than O(N2), as in worst case, it will perform
1010 operations as N is 105. So complexity acceptable for this case is either O(NlogN) which is 
approximately 106 (105 * ~10) operations well under 108 or O(N).

For Case 3: Even O(NlogN) gives us TLE as it performs ~109 operations which are over 108. 
So, the only solution which is acceptable is O(N) which in worst case will perform 10^8 operations.
